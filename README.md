This repository contains projects completed for graduate courses (generalized linear models and statistical learning) at Wake Forest University in fall 2022.
The project labeled "PredictingExerciseLRFS" explores two research questions concerning exercise and health among American adults: first, whether there is a relationship between the amount of weight a person wants to lose and the probability that they exercise regularly, after accounting for the personâ€™s age, general state of health, and whether they have healthcare coverage; and second, how accurately we can predict that a person regularly exercises. The project includes both a logistic regression model and a forward selection with AIC model, using the first to conclude that there is a relationship between desired weight change and regular exercise, and using the second to attempt to predict whether a person regularly exercises with greatest possible accuracy. The data examined in this project was collected in a Centers for Disease Control telephone survey, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ([BRFSS](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/)).
The project labeled "PredictingRentalPricing" aims to develop a model that can be used to predict the nightly price of a rental property. Accurate pricing prediction would enable rental property owners to decide how to price new properties such that they are likeliest to be successfully rented out. This report analyzes twelve features (based on customer ratings, architectural configuration and capacity, location, and transportation-related metrics) of over 1,500 rental properties listed on vacation rental site VRBO. The report then constructs three possible models for predicting the nightly price of a rental property, using ridge regression, then the lasso method, and finally the elastic net method.
